# Othello
Python code for the two-player game Othello.

## Usage
In order to play the game in graphical mode pygame is required:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

This script will launch in graphical mode by default.
To play in the previous version issue a "-c" flag:

```
$ python main.py -c     //launches in text mode
$ python main.py        //launches in graphical mode
```
